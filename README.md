# Trust Decision Chinese Security Solver

This software lets you

- Generate infinite dynamic fingerprints
- Generate infinite TD pass tokens with no detection

Some of the web securities flaws include:

- TLS fingerprint checks not present on token domain
    - However TLS checks present on retail site domain
- Fingerprint payload verification and parsing is not present
- System versioning is not enforced
- Dynamic script version does not function correctly due to no payload verification
- Subsequent tokens and signs can be flawed but still pass

Suggested Fixes:

- Fix the bugs mentioned above
- Fully dynamic web VM deployed to end customers on 30 minute intervals
- VM generated by LLM
- LLM will randomize:
    - Obfuscuation
    - Encryption
    - FP payload format/content
    - Enforce payload content, order, format for validation

**Features**

- Easily deploy on google cloud run
- Easy updates
- Different TLS signature options
- Each solve has its own env and stack/heap memory leading to zero device leaks

**To Update/Deploy**

- Ensure Google cloud artifacte reigstry, cloud run, firebase database setup access added

run: gcloud auth login

- gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/xbot-2b603/td-solver

gcloud run deploy td-solver \
--image=gcr.io/xbot-2b603/td-solver \
--platform=managed \
--region=us-central1 \
--allow-unauthenticated

- replace "xbot-2b603" with your cloud project id
